# MMR Grabber
This tool is used to automatically track your match maker rating (MMR) in the game Starcraft 2.

# How it works
At the end of every game of Starcraft 2, you are taken to a "Game Summary" screen that displays information about the last game, including your current MMR. This code scans your screen until it recognizes that you are on the "Game Summary" screen, at which point it extracts the MMR from the page. This can be expanded to create a spreadsheet with information about every game played.
